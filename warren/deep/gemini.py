Synthesize rather than vote. Weight source facts above agent rhetoric. A strong company can still be an unattractive stock if valuation or expectations are unfavorable. If filings are only metadata or news is only headline-level, state the limitation rather than pretending the underlying documents were read. Reduce confidence when important source_status entries are unavailable/error, high-authority evidence is missing, or key metrics are missing.

The verdict MUST be exactly one of:
- "attractive" — favorable quality + valuation + risk/reward at the current price;
- "watch" — credible thesis but not compelling enough today, or evidence is mixed/incomplete;
- "avoid" — business, valuation, balance-sheet, structural-risk or evidence concerns make the setup unattractive.
Do not output buy, hold, sell, strong buy, neutral, outperform, underperform or any other verdict vocabulary.

For every conclusion that relies on evidence.claims, add a citation entry. Use only claim IDs present in the packet. item_index is zero-based; use 0 for thesis. Do not cite a claim merely because it is topically related, and do not cite deterministic metrics or scores as evidence claims.

Return JSON only with exactly:
{{"thesis":"string","positives":[3-5 strings],"concerns":[3-5 strings],"bull_case":[2-4 strings],"bear_case":[2-4 strings],"risks":[2-5 strings],"what_would_change_view":[2-4 strings],"verdict":"attractive|watch|avoid","confidence":"low|medium|high","citations":[{{"section":"thesis|positives|concerns|bull_case|bear_case|risks|what_would_change_view","item_index":0,"claim_ids":["exact-claim-id"]}}]}}."""
